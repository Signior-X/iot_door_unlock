# iot_door_unlock

#### The Idea
- [x] A face detector which authenticates the user
- [ ] Then we need to see how to connect to nodemcu, in the android app
- [ ] Then after the connection, if the user authenticates properly, we need to open the door lock
- [ ] The door lock needs to be seen what to do or any thing like switiching on the light etc.

#### The action plan
After planning about this, we will decide the components which need to be bought and who will be going to do the tasks. The ones which can be done remotely,
we will divide and the ones which need user interaction, we need to see. We have to also see from where we are going to buy the components.

Then the real task begins of joining the parts and doing the actual testing.
