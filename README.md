# iot_door_unlock

#### The Idea
Door unlock and security using the Biometric convenience of your own smartphone.

#### Structure
`base.apk` used in the video `implementation_video.mp4`.
The Arduino code is in `lock_bluetooth.ino`.
The main presentation in `Prototyping presentation.pdf`

#### The action plan
After planning about this, we will decide the components which need to be bought and who will be going to do the tasks. The ones which can be done remotely,
we will divide and the ones which need user interaction, we need to see. We have to also see from where we are going to buy the components.

Then the real task begins of joining the parts and doing the actual testing.
